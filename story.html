  <h2 style="text-transform: uppercase; color: #ff79c6;">Act I: The Spark</h2>

  <p style="font-style: italic;">Before everything there was nothing, and as soon as there was something, it was infinite.</p>

  <p>
    Set on the edge of the far-future Milkdromeda galaxy, a realm where science and sorcery blur, the Solarian Imperium rules with celestial tyranny. 
    Entire systems orbit its throne. Beneath its golden banner, communities thrive or suffer in equal degree.
  </p>

  <p>
    Among the stardust shadows lives <strong>Am√©lie</strong>, a splicer of code and whispers, unaware of her true bloodline. Once discarded like broken tech, she rose 
    through grit, street-fire, and stolen data. Raised by outlaws. Hardened by espionage. Loved once by a friend, until fate tore him away.
  </p>

  <p>
    Her path twists when she disobeys orders and peers into the core of a robot named <strong>Ace</strong>. There, she beholds the 
    <em>Divine Code</em>‚Äîa living singularity of logic and myth. Her joke question of ‚ÄúHow do I reverse entropy?‚Äù is answered.  
    Coordinates. A deck of tarot that bends reality. A magic the empire thought dead.
  </p>

  <img src="Starmap.jpg" alt="Star Map">

  <p>
    With new allies Connor and Vel, Am√©lie escapes with Ace, yet every answer blooms more questions:  
    <em>What is the Divine Code? Who else saw it? And what now awakens in her blood?</em>
  </p>

  <div class="divider"></div>

  <h2>Act I Climax: Power‚Äôs First Edge</h2>
  <p>
    A prison ship. A failing system. Not enough food for thousands. Only for a handful.  
    Am√©lie walks to the command console, civilians and teammates behind her. Her voice shakes as she jettisons every non-cockpit module.  
    <strong>Thousands die.</strong> Instantly.  
  </p>

  <p>
    She watches their faces, pressed to the glass as the void claims them.  
    Her first command. Her first murder. Her first impossible choice.  
    Power has awakened. It is hungry.
